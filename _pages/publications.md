#### To Adapt or not to Adapt: How Swiss Fruit Farmers respond to Climate Change

<blockquote>
  <p>
   Anthropogenic climate change is affecting the characteristics of weather and climate extremes. In 2018, in Switzerland, it was the sixth warmest month of July recorded since measurements began in 1864. As a result of warming, the frequency, intensity, and character of many extreme events will also change, in particular for hot days, heat waves, cold waves, and heavy precipitation. Agricultural activities depend on favourable climate conditions and are at risk in a changing climate; therefore, farmers are likely to take a long-term perspective on climate due to its direct impact on their livelihoods. Effective adaptation to and mitigation of climate change requires both an understanding of the causes and impacts of climate change and a willingness to change behaviour. This research project aims at understanding the relationship between climate and specific perennial crops, and between climate perceptions and adaptation behaviour of Swiss fruit farmers.

####  On the Interactions between Domestic and International Policy and the Prospects for International Climate Cooperation (with <a href="http://www.ralph-winkler.de">Ralph Winkler</a> and <a href="https://www.unibo.it/sitoweb/alessandro.tavoni2/en">Alessandro Tavoni</a>)

<blockquote>
  <p>
   Despite the success of the Paris Agreement, anthropogenic climate change remains one of humanity’s most pressing challenges. Like with previous agreements (e.g., the Kyoto Protocol), we observe little progress in climate change mitigation: in almost all countries, current greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions are above their agreed upon pledges and even complying with these pledges will not achieve the acknowledged policy goal of containing the increase of the average surface temperature below 2 °C compared to the pre-industrial levels. The main reasons are the public good characteristic of GHG emission reductions and the absence of a supranational authority that can enforce cooperation. In this project, we employ methods of non-cooperative game theory and experimental economics to contribute to the understanding of the obstacles and prospects of international climate cooperation
