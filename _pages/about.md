Iâ€™m a year PhD Candidate in Climate and Agricultural Economics at the <a href="https://www.vwi.unibe.ch/index_eng.html">Department of Economics</a> and the <a href="https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch">Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (OCCR)</a> at the University of Bern. I am currently on a research visit at <a href="https://www.columbia.edu">Columbia University</a> under the supervision of <a href="http://www.columbia.edu/~ws2162/">Prof. Dr. Wolfram Schlenker</a>.

My research focuses on assessing the impact of climate change on agricultural production, farmer behaviour, adaptation strategies and international environmental agreements.
