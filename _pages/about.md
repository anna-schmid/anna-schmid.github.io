I am a PhD Candidate in Climate and Agricultural Economics at the <a href="https://www.vwi.unibe.ch/index_eng.html">Department of Economics</a> and the <a href="https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch">Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (OCCR)</a> at the University of Bern.

I visited Columbia University in New York City in 2023/2024, sponsored by Wolfram Schlenker.

My research focuses on climate change's impact on crops, farmers' adaptation, and international environmental agreements.
