Iâ€™m a third year PhD Candidate in Climate and Agricultural Economics at the <a href="https://www.vwi.unibe.ch/index_eng.html">Department of Economics</a> and the <a href="https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch">Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (OCCR)</a>  at the University of Bern. Hello

My research focuses on assessing the impact of climate change on agricultural production, farmer behaviour, adaptation strategies and international environmental agreements.
