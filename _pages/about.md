Iâ€™m currently part of the <a href="https://learning.eitfood.eu/courses/innovator-fellowship">EIT Food Innovator Fellowship</a> and working as a DeepTech Associate (Geospatial & AI) with <a href="https://cinsoil.eu">CinSOIL</a>. My background is in climate and agricultural economics, which I explored in depth during my PhD at the University of Bernâ€™s <a href="https://www.vwi.unibe.ch/index_eng.html">Department of Economics</a> and the <a href="https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch">Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (OCCR)</a>.

In 2023/2024, I spent a research stay at Columbia University in New York, supported by Wolfram Schlenker, where I dove deeper into data-driven approaches to environmental challenges.

Iâ€™m especially interested in how climate change affects crops and farmers, how we adapt, and how international cooperation can actually work. What really excites me is using data and code to move from research to real-world impact, turning insight into action.

Always open to connecting, just drop me a line.
