## Welcome! 
Iâ€™m a second year PhD Candidate in Climate Economics at the <a href="https://www.vwi.unibe.ch/index_eng.html">Department of Economics</a> and the <a href="https://www.oeschger.unibe.ch">Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research (OCCR)</a>  at the University of Bern. My main research interests are in agricultural and climate economics with a focus on climate impacts and international environmental agreements.
